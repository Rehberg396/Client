  The information provided in the service relies on available data captured and
  transmitted by the telematic service provider of the vehicle. However, the
  actual vehicle condition depends on many other factors, which assessment
  require physical access to the vehicle. Fault codes indicate failures, which
  have to be verified in a workshop. Risk classification only considers possible
  symptoms based on transmitted fault code and not actually active symptoms.
  There might be more or other symptoms active at the vehicle, and the vehicle's
  user manual has to be respected at all times.
